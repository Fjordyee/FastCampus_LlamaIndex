website (https://www.forb\\nes.com/billionaires/)\\nThe World's Billionaires\\nThe World's Billionaires is an annual\\nranking of people who are billionaires, i.e.,\\nthey are considered to have a net worth of\\nUS$1 billion or more, by the American\\nbusiness magazine Forbes. The list was first\\npublished in March 1987.[1] The total net\\nworth of each individual on the list is\\nestimated and is cited in United States\\ndollars, based on their documented assets and\\naccounting for debt and other factors.\\nRoyalty and dictators whose wealth comes\\nfrom their positions are excluded from these\\nlists.[3] This ranking is an index of the\\nwealthiest documented individuals, excluding\\nany ranking of those with wealth that is not\\nable to be completely ascertained.[4]\\nIn 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was\\nranked at the top for the first time and\\nbecame the first centibillionaire included in\\nthe ranking,[5] surpassing Microsoft founder\\nBill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the\\nprevious 24 years. In 2022, after topping the\\nlist for four years, Bezos was surpassed by\\nElon Musk.[6] In 2023, Musk was in turn\\nsurpassed by French businessman Bernard\\nArnault, after topping the list for just a year.\\nArnault became the first French person to top\\nthe list.[2]\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of over 50\\nreporters from a variety of countries to track\\nthe activity of the world's wealthiest\\nindividuals[7] and sometimes groups or\\nfamilies – who share wealth. Preliminary\\nsurveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of\\nresponses\\xa0– some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse\\nto answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets\\xa0 – land,\\nhomes, vehicles, artwork, etc.\\xa0– are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the\\nestimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a\\nMethodology\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n"," Document(id_='66adbf83-b2fd-433f-bc3f-ae57a933458b', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 32, 'file_path': '/content/billionaires_page.pdf', 'source': '2'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-\\nsales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an\\nindividual\\'s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual\\'s true\\nwealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a\\nsingle listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a\\ndeceased billionaire\\'s fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will\\nonly appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $1 billion (his or her net worth will not be combined\\nwith family members\\').[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are\\nalways excluded from these lists.[9]\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time.\\nThese lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\nIcon\\nDescription\\nHas not changed from the previous ranking.\\nHas increased from the previous ranking.\\nHas decreased from the previous ranking.\\nIn the 37th annual Forbes list of the world\\'s billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net\\nwealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy\\ncompared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks\\nfor the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since\\n2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world\\'s richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15\\nunder 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of\\n$34.7 billion.
