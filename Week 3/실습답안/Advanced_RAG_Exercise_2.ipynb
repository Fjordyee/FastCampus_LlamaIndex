일본을 세계의 7대 강국으로 공식인정하는 계기가 되었다. 당시 러시아는 세계에서 영국에 이은 해군 강국으로 해군의 어뢰정 운용과 전술에 있어 최고로 인정 받고 있었으며, 해군 전술 전략에 있어 세계적으로 존경을 받고 있는 마카로프 제독과 같은 전략가가 있었다. 마카로프 제독은 1904년 일러전쟁 발발 직 후 여순항 해전 중 일본 연함 함대를 발견하고 쫓아가다 기뢰에 걸려 파편에 맞아 즉사했다. 그러나 일러전쟁의 해전에 있어 일본에는 천재적인 전략가 도고 헤이아치로와 그에게는 독보적인 해전전술이 있었고, 쓰시마 해전의 승전의 모든 전공은 도고 헤이아치로에게 있었다. 도고 헤이아치로의 존재는 세계적 명장으로 꼽히는 야마토 이소로쿠가 성장하는 밑거름이 되었다. 레이다와 미사일이 해전의 주된 무기가 되었음에도 쓰시마해전의 도고헤이아치로의 T자 타법, 즉 일제타법((salvo strike)은 여전히 현대 해군전의 교과서가 되었고 세계의 모든 해군사관학교에서 가르친다. 쓰시마 해전에서 약 3배의 전력적 우세를 가지고 있었던 러시아는 도주한 순양함 3척을 제외하고 19척이 침몰했고, 7척이 나포 되었으며 인명피해는 16,170명 중 5,000여명이 전사하고 1,000여명이 부상당했다. 또한 6,000여명이 포로로 붙잡혔다. 반면에 일본은 어뢰정 3척이 침몰한 것 외에 사망자는 110여명, 부상자는 600여명 내외였다. 당시 세계 최강의 함대로 인정 받았던 발틱함대는 사실상 궤멸 되었다. 도고 헤이아치로는 일러전쟁에서 봉천대회전의 영웅 육군의 노기 마레스케와 같이 군신으로 추앙받았다. 임진왜란 때 일본은 성웅 이순신의 한산도 대첩으로 사실상 해로를 통한 전쟁을 포기했다. 한산도 대첩의 대승의 비결은 성웅 이순신의 학익진이었다.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=959, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}:

되었다. 아마도 이와 같은 해전의 결과는 이전에도 없었고 이후에도 없을 것이다. 일본은 성웅 이순신에게 수십번의 치욕적인 패배를 당했다. 그리고 개항과 근대화 과정에서 노량해전에서 대패한 시미즈 요시히로가 다이묘로 있었던 사쓰마 번이 주도 되어 창군한 일본의 해군은 철저하게 이순신 장군을 연구하고 배웠다. 일본 해군 소장 가와다 이사오가 쓴 \"포탄을 뚫고\"라는 책에는 \"이순신 장군은 당시의 조선에서 유일하게 청렴한 장군이었고 충성심과 전술전략 운영 능력은 최고의 경지에 이르렀다. 그러나 조선은 이순신 장군의 정신과 전술을 금방 잊어버리고 38년 만에 병자호란을 다시 당했다. 조선에서는 이순신 장군의 이름이 까마득히 잊혀졌지만 일본에서는 그를 존경하여 메이지(明治)시기 신식 해군이 창설되었을 때 그의 업적과 전술을 연구하였다\"라고 밝히고 있다. 또한, 19세기 말 일본 해군사관학교에서는 \"이순신전술전략\"이라는 교과목을 가르쳤다. 성웅 이순신 장군을 군신으로 모시고 추종했던 일러전쟁의 영웅 도고 헤이아치로는 이순신 장군에 대한 경외심에 대한 기록을 남겨 놓고 있다. 영국에 8년간 유학하며 넬슨 장군을 연구한 도고헤이아치로의 우상은 언제나 이순신
